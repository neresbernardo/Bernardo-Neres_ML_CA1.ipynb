Firewall Traffic Classification Assessment

Scenario:
This is a data set which contains over 65K attempts to access a firewall. There is a single categorical feature “Action”, that contains 4 categories – “allow, deny, drop, reset-both”.
Your task is to create a classification model that will predict the class of incoming traffic to the firewall. 

Requirements

EDA: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and its relevance to classification algorithms.  
Data Preparation: Prepare the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting data into training and testing sets.  
Classification Algorithms: Implement at least 2 classification algorithms, test them, and discuss findings.  
Model Evaluation: Evaluate final classification algorithm using test data and comment on accuracy differential between training and testing sets.
